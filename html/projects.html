                    This is the website you are on right now!
                    This is a static site hosted on a <strong>Linode nanode server</strong>
                    using <strong>Nginx</strong> to serve files. Using a static site with Nginx ensures
                    performance and reliability while also reducing complexity, especially
                    since my personal information rarely changes and is not expansive
                    enough to justify a dedicated database. I designed and implemented all
                    HTML, CSS, and SVG files in this project. I also recently added OpenAI
                    integration via a Django webapp. The Django webapp is running on a separate
                    server but appears to be a seamless component of the static site thanks to
                    Nginx's proxy feature. Requests to the /openai/ endpoint are forwarded
                    to another server that processes the data and returns a Django template
                    with the desired information.

                    Niner Miner was the final project for my computer science
                    capstone in university. The intention was to provide a service
                    similar to OfferUp or Facebook Marketplace, but required additional 
                    authentication in the form of a school email address. It was
                    designed and implemented by a team that included myself and 4 
                    other students. We collaborated on the project using GitHub for 
                    version control, used Figma to prototype all UIs, and used Flask
                    for the application backend and HTML templating. The application
                    also includes responsive styling. Due to the restricted market
                    for such a tool and expense of running multiple servers for a 
                    non-active service, this application is offline.
